# TAJ Crypto

Taj Crypto is a website that showcases the working of various different cipher including playfair cipher,Hill cipher etc.It takes the plain text as an input from the user and outputs its corresponding cipher text using the correspondig encryption algorithm.

It includes the following ciphers : 

* Casear Cipher
* OneTimePad Cipher
* Monoalphabetic Cipher
* Polyalphabetic Cipher
* Keyless Transposition Cipher
* Columnar Cipher
* Playfair Cipher
* Hill Cipher

Working of Ciphers 

* Casear Cipher

The action of a Caesar cipher is to replace each plaintext letter with a different one a fixed number of places down the alphabet. The cipher illustrated here uses a left shift of three, so that (for example) each occurrence of E in the plaintext becomes B in the ciphertext.

* Monoalphabetic Cipher

A monoalphabetic cipher is any cipher in which the letters of the plain text are mapped to cipher text letters based on a single alphabetic key. Examples of monoalphabetic ciphers would include the Caesar-shift cipher, where each letter is shifted based on a numeric key, and the atbash cipher, where each letter is mapped to the letter symmetric to it about the center of the alphabet.

* Polyalphabetic Cipher

A polyalphabetic cipher is any cipher based on substitution, using multiple substitution alphabets. The Vigenère cipher is probably the best-known example of a polyalphabetic cipher, though it is a simplified special case.

* Keyless Transposition Cipher

Keyless Transportation cipher is simple one which is keyless. In first method the text is written into a table column by column and then row by row. In the second method the text is written into the table row by row and then transmitted column by column.

* Columnar Cipher

The Columnar Transposition Cipher is a form of transposition cipher just like Rail Fence Cipher. Columnar Transposition involves writing the plaintext out in rows, and then reading the ciphertext off in columns one by one.

* Playfair Cipher

The Playfair cipher was the first practical digraph substitution cipher. The scheme was invented in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone but was named after Lord Playfair who promoted the use of the cipher. In playfair cipher unlike traditional cipher we encrypt a pair of alphabets(digraphs) instead of a single alphabet.

* Hill Cipher

Hill cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra.Each letter is represented by a number modulo 26. Often the simple scheme A = 0, B = 1, …, Z = 25 is used, but this is not an essential feature of the cipher. To encrypt a message, each block of n letters (considered as an n-component vector) is multiplied by an invertible n × n matrix, against modulus 26.
